# Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office Workshops

## [Creative Workflows Using QGIS and SQL]
_Hayden Elza - February 2024_

Whether youâ€™ve been meaning to check out QGIS or SQL or you already have experience but want to see some unique use patterns and tricks, complete this workshop to build your own [witness tree map] using data from the original land survey of Wisconsin. Topics covered include [filtered datasets], [virtual layers], virtual fields, [geometry generator] symbology, label placement, [adding database connections], database views, QGIS plugins, and spatial queries in Postgres. If you are familiar with QGIS or other GIS software, you should be good to go; no prior knowledge of SQL or topics mentioned earlier required.
